# Do not delete this file

The `VichUploaderBundle` handles the file upload process when the entity is persisted. 
This includes moving the file from a temporary location to its final destination, as defined in your VichUploader configuration.

When you set the `File` instance on your `Media` entity, you're associating the file with the entity. 
The actual file move happens when you call `$manager->flush();`, which triggers the lifecycle callbacks of the Doctrine entity.

The directory namer of `VichUploader` configuration is applied during this process. 
It determines the final path (relative to the storage directory you configured in VichUploader) where the file will be stored.

This directory is used as a temporary directory (`/Copies`) because the files within it will be moved to the final location, 
as determined by the directory namer, when the entity is persisted.

For this reason, it will always be empty but not useless.
