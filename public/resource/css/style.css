/**
Custom Style Configuration
--------------------------

Customizing CSS using variables can greatly enhance maintainability and flexibility in your stylesheets. 
By defining variables at the root level (:root), you establish a centralized repository of values that 
can be easily adjusted throughout your project.

For instance:

:root {
    --sidebar-bg: lightgrey;
    --main-text-color: black;
    --accent-color: var(--sidebar-bg);
}

These variables can then be applied across your stylesheets, promoting consistency and making it simpler to 
update your design scheme in the future.
